- I added string.format 

Gained 84% performance by making the following assumptions: 

- Meta-methods (__index and __call) will only work for calls / methods.

- Math meta-methods (__add, __sub, etc) are all disabled.

- Use ipairs() to iterate through lists, not pairs()

- Your tables will contain .$metatable, if used.

- Your tables will contain .$length, sometimes.

Heavy use of table.insert / table.remove will result in a performance hit.
